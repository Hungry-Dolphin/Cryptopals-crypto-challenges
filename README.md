Today I decided to see how far I would get doing the cryptopals crypto challenges

So far I had to cheat once by looking up why there where spelling mistakes in my set 1 challenge 6 key and if that was the reason I could not decrypt the message. 
Turns out my solution to count english characters from challenge 3 was cute but not accurate enough when used for challenge 6. 

Times I cheated so far:
